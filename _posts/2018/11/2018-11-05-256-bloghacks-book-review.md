Most people who start a blog face the questions that are common for newcomers:
How to make it popular? What blogging platform to choose? And, in some cases, how make
money from it? However, these questions have no exact answers,
just as there are no magic bullets for blogging. The moment you realize that, you change your
strategy and start looking for successful bloggers and try to learn from their experience.
One of such bloggers is [Yegor Bugayenko] the author of the "[256 Bloghacks]".

<!--more-->

The book presents itself as a set of DO and DONTs. Most of them and quiet short and span for
less than a page. This format has been proven (at least for me) to be effective as it allows
the author to keep the reader's attention and makes the "hacks" memorable.

The introductory chapter of the book is committed to the attitude to blogging and the direct
monetary expectations of it. Overall, I have found the content of the first chapter to be plain and obvious,
for the most part. As a reader of the book of a successful blogger I expect to see something more than a
recommendation not to put any pop-ups or banners on the blog. That is something that I would
expect from a "blog tips free" Google search, but not from a $40 book. On a positive side,
Yegor also discusses the importance of the reasons that have led you to the decision that
you need to have your own blog. In essence, he explains how and why your motivations will
affect the performance and success of your blog.

The most important and the main part of the book is dedicated to the various kinds of
tips regarding the content of a blog. Yegor presents in detail how the posts should be
formatted, what style to follow, what kinds of posts should be avoided and which ones
should be posted more frequently that the others. What made me believe that the "hacks"
are actually effective is that the author relates them back to his own blog. He shows that
what he first thought to be effective, turned out to be a terrible mistake and vice versa.
This kind of argumentation is the driver of the book and something that makes
the "hacks" credible.

In the "Social" chapter, Yegor reveals which social networks have resulted in more traffic
to his blog compared with the others. In addition, he presents strategies for effective
content sharing for each of the social network separately. The book also has a number
of "hacks" regarding [SEO], such as the discussion about *[Google Search Console]*,
[sitemap] and other.

The last set of "bloghacks" are related to the technical details of a blog implementation.
Yegor strongly encourages using a static-site generator such as [jekyll]. He also insists on
using [Continuous Integration] and [Github] for blog maintenance. Personally, I find Yegor's
suggestion to learn the basics of [Git], [Ruby] and other technicalities unnecessary. Nowadays,
there are countless ways to set up a blog. Sure, if you are a developer, then this might be worth
it and will bring you additional advantages, which are described in the book. However, if
are not a programmer and want to have a unique personal blog, then it's better to invest money
rather that personal time and order it somewhere.

So, how can can get all of the "256 Bloghacks" for free? It's pretty simple. All of them can be found
on the [Yegor's blog]. If study it carefully you will be able to deduce most of the hacks
from it. In addition, Yegor's blog is [open-source], meaning that you can adopt the
technical "hacks" too. He even has a special [demo version] of his blog, which can be used as a
base for your own blog. Unfortunately, this demo version is outdated and does not work out
of the box (notice the "build failing" badge). If you ever
need this kind of base for your blog, feel free to use [mine]. It is as a fork
of the Yegor's demo blog with bug fixes, updates and improvements integrated.

Will I recommend this book? The answer is yes. Although it does not have any super-secrets,
it is succinct, tries to be honest with the reader and, overall, is a solid foundation for a new blogger.
